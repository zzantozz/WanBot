You need the WanBot's email user/pw to do anything. Set them in properties:
wanbot.gmail.user
wanbot.gmail.password

You can use system properties, environment vars (I think), or, preferably, a
maven profile in your local settings. Don't commit the user/password.

To run this thing, first compile (with tests!):
mvn test

Then process new messages:
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=org.wanbot.WanBotDriver

Finally, send the email summary:
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=org.wanbot.NotificationsDriver
